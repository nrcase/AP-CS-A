 * Class:AP Computer Science A
 * Assignment Name: M2L1 Practice Assignment
 * Program Name: NickCaseHelloWorld
 * Date: 9/2/19
 * Description: This is my first program on my own. It prints out "Hello World!"
 * Difficulties: Intially, I forgot to create the main class and so I had to delete my code and then go back and create the main class.
 * I also forgot to put semicolons at the end, but the error detector alerted it to me and I fixed it.
 * What did I learn?: I learned how to create the skeleton of a program so that later I can add more to it.
 * I also learned how to display an output such as text or mathmatical functions
 * In addition, I also learned how to add comments to my programs to make it more readable for myself and others.
